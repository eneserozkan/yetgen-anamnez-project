# yetgen-anamnez-project
Medical history taking aims at understanding the problem to be dealt with and guiding the clinical examination.

A doctor-medical student typically asks questions to obtain the following information about the patient:
The complaint
/History of the present illness
/Past medical history
/Review of systems
/Family diseases

We aim to facilitate the doctor's anamnesis process so we developed this project. With this project, we will shorten the time for the doctor to take anamnesis.
